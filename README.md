# FlowCrossVote

## What we do?

A cross-chain Voting solution to get votations from multiple EVM \& Non-EVM chains into the Flow Blockchain using Router Protocol.

A crosschain voting app takes it a step further, addressing the issue of interoperability among different blockchain networks. By leveraging crosschain technology, it allows voters from various blockchain ecosystems to participate seamlessly in elections, transcending boundaries and fostering inclusivity. This innovative approach enhances the app's resilience, scalability, and accessibility, making it a powerful tool for shaping the future of global governance.

## How we distinguish from other Voting Protocols?
1. Restict Votations to only allowed candidates can vote, attracting insitutions that need identity verification for this
2. Highly Compatible with other projects, allowing other smart contracts to interact with it,
like DAOs and other contracts
3. Prevent frauds of bots voting, thanks to restrctions to some candidates
4. Votes stored in users storage and not in central smart contract, giving transparency, security, and immutability
5. Fast secure and Scalable architecture
6. CrossChain Voting(soon)

## Challenges

Although we cannot add the crosschain to the voting app due to no protocol has made flow interoperable, we have plans to integrate router protocol to the app when router protocol integrates flow, so we can become crosschain in future, at the moment the product is only available using flow blockchain
